## NOTE: I just gave an example in the API. You can use it in your cron job. <br> I have created an API event and will trigger when the event occur. It depends on you when you want to trigger that event like your API or cron job. <br> It may stuck on timeout or long request. So, in that case you just need to send the response to their API, It will be inform of message broadcast, no need to wait for their API. <br> So, I only created a simple Webhook in this tutorial to give you simple idea about how Webhook works. <br> It depends on the user how and when they want to broadcast the response.

## To get the data automatically, you can use a socket connection, so whenever you have new data in the database, then you can automatically send data back to UI.
